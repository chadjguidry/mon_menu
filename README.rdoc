What is it?
Mon Menu, or My Menu is a simple web application created to help me determine what to cook for future meals. It is a virtual menu that allows me to store my favorite foods and snacks to reference when deciding what I want to eat throughout the week. I use it by adding only foods that I know I enjoy, and then reference the menu whenever I have trouble deciding what I would like to eat for upcoming meals.

How does it work?
The application is intuitive and straight-forward. When you sign up, you will have your own menu that you can manage. This menu is your own private menu and only accessible through your login. There are only 3 categories of foods. A food can be a Main Dish, a Side Dish, or a Snack, and foods are grouped and viewed by these categories. For me, deciding on a meal consists of choosing a Main Dish, and a Side Dish or two. I use the Snack category to store my favorite treats and desserts.
